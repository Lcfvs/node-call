node-call
=========

Node module to simply call a function asynchronously, under the MIT license.


Imagine an old phone system...

You have to send a call, an operator receives your instructions, he sends a channel for you to give the following instructions.

Of course, the operator call asked may take a while before being accepted or rejected.

During this time, what the operator must to do, based on the response, resolved or rejected, and even what to do after, regardless of the response.


This module is browser compatible.
